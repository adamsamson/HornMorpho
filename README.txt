This is version 3.5 of HornMorphoA, a Python program that performs morphological
analysis, generation, and grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in six languages
of the Horn of Africa.
HornMorpho is part of the Processing Languages of the Global South
project (http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/gasser/plogs.html). If you want
to work with one of the other languages covered by HornMorpho, you
will need to install the full version of the program; the installer is
in Versions/3.5.

To install HornMorpho, extract the files from the archive. Then go to
the directory HornMorphoA-3.5 and do 

  python setup.py install

making sure that you are using Python 3.

For information about using the program, see the manual that came with
the distribution: horn3.1A_quick.pdf.
